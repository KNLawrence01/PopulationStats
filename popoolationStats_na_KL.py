# This script takes in bams from pool-seq, subsamples to minimize effects of
# differential coverage and calculates genome wide population statistics (pi, theta, and Tajima's D) using Popoolation.
# Note: paths to Popoolation and Samtools scripts and path to reference genome  and target coverage for subsampling are hard coded.

### Edited by Kadee L to get rid of pi and theta at end results
#Changed to work for Mtb: orginal code for GV by topfm:MadelineTopf
